## React Button specification

Buttons handle actions and can contain icons. You can have filled primary buttons or unfilled ghost buttons. If the button is disabled, you can include a message of how to enable it where appropriate.

### Component usage
```js
<Button text="Click me" />
```

### Using props to customize the text

Modify the text to see it change live:
```js live
<Button text="act through me" variance="ghost" />
```
